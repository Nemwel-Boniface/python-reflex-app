# Welcome to Reflex!
# Python Reflex App

This repository outlines the steps to create a basic app using the Reflex framework. [Reflex](https://reflex.dev/) is a library to build full-stack web apps in pure Python. Reflex packs around the following key features:

1. Built your applications using pure Python - Write your app's frontend and backend all in Python, no need to learn Javascript.
2. Reflex offers full Flexibility - Reflex is easy to get started with, but can also scale to complex apps.
3. Reflex allows you to easily deploy your applications Instantly - After building, deploy your app with a [single command](https://reflex.dev/docs/hosting/deploy-quick-start/) or host it on your own server.

## Description

This project is a simple web application built with Reflex, a Python library. The app displays a "Hello World!" message and includes a button that, when clicked, fetches details about cat facts from a specified URL and displays the content.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
### Prerequisites
1. Make sure that you have Python installed on your local machine. Check your version using ```python3 --version```. If you do not receive your Python Version, please install Python for your respective operating system.
2. You now need to install Reflex using ```pip install reflex```. If you do not have "pip' installed you will have to install it by running ```sudo apt install python3-pip```

    ```bash
    git@github.com:Nemwel-Boniface/python-reflex-app.git
    cd python-reflex-app
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install reflex requests
    ```
4. Initialize your reflex application by running this cmd
```
reflex init
```
5. Once that completes, you can run the application with the below command. If successful, your application can be found here: ```http://localhost:3000/```
```

## Configuration

The app is configured using a `Config` object from Reflex:

```python
config = rx.Config(
    app_name="reflex_dev",
)
```

# Project deployment
Reflex offers an easy way to deploy your applications which can be checked out from their main docs [here](https://reflex.dev/docs/hosting/deploy-quick-start/). I was able to deploy my own project and if you are interested in having a look at it online, please do so from this URL ```https://python-reflex-app.reflex.run/```
